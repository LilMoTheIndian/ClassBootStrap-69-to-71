            <p class="text-muted text-left">New York, often called New York City to distinguish it from New York State, or NYC for short, is the most populous city in the United States. With a 2020 population of 8,804,190 distributed over 300.46 square miles (778.2 km2),[2] New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the State of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, the largest metropolitan area in the world by urban area.[9] With over 20 million people in its metropolitan statistical area and approximately 23 million in its combined statistical area, it is one of the world's most populous megacities. New York City has been described as the cultural, financial, and media capital of the world, significantly influencing commerce,[10] entertainment, research, technology, education, politics, tourism, art, fashion, and sports, and is the most photographed city in the world.[11] Home to the headquarters of the United Nations,[12] New York is an important center for international diplomacy,[13][14] and has sometimes been called the capital of the world.</p>

            <p class="text-muted text-left">New York City traces its origins to a trading post founded on the southern tip of Manhattan Island by Dutch colonists in approximately 1624.[23] The settlement was named New Amsterdam (Dutch: Nieuw Amsterdam) in 1626 and was chartered as a city in 1653.[24] The city came under English control in 1664 and was renamed New York after King Charles II of England granted the lands to his brother, the Duke of York.[24][25] The city was regained by the Dutch in July 1673 and was renamed New Orange for one year and three months; the city has been continuously named New York since November 1674.[26][27] New York City was the capital of the United States from 1785 until 1790,[28] and has been the largest U.S. city since 1790.[29] The Statue of Liberty greeted millions of immigrants as they came to the U.S. by ship in the late 19th and early 20th centuries,[30] and is a symbol of the U.S. and its ideals of liberty and peace.[31] In the 21st century, New York has emerged as a global node of creativity, entrepreneurship,[32] and environmental sustainability,[33][34] and as a symbol of freedom and cultural diversity.[35] In 2019, New York was voted the greatest city in the world per a survey of over 30,000 people from 48 cities worldwide, citing its cultural diversity.</p>

            <h5 class="text-success text-left text-capitalize">i had visited in July 2021</h5>
            <p class="text-muted text-left">Galveston is a coastal resort city and port off the Southeast Texas coast on Galveston Island and Pelican Island in the U.S. state of Texas. The community of 209.3 square miles (542 km2), with a population of 47,743 in 2010,[7] is the county seat of surrounding Galveston County and second-largest municipality in the county. It is also within the Houston–The Woodlands–Sugar Land metropolitan area at its southern end on the northwestern coast of the Gulf of Mexico.

Galveston, or Galvez' town, was named after the Spanish military and political leader in the 18th century: Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez (1746–1786), who was born in Macharaviaya, Málaga, in the Kingdom of Spain. Galveston's first European settlements on the Galveston Island were built around 1816 by French pirate Louis-Michel Aury to help the fledgling Republic of Mexico fight for independence from Spain, along with other colonies in the Western Hemisphere of the Americas in Central and South America in the 1810s and 1820s. The Port of Galveston was established in 1825 by the Congress of Mexico following its independence from Spain. The city was the main port for the fledgling Texas Navy during the Texas Revolution of 1836, and later served temporarily as the new national capital of the Republic of Texas.</p>

            <p>Saw it today with my family and we loved it.You should have a minimal previous understanding of the movies or you’ll miss 40% of the fun.At minimum:Infinity WarCivil WarBlack PantherAge of Ant Man and the WaspProblem is that the whole movie is homage to all movies. Yet you will enjoy it a lot.There is at the beginning of the movie a (spoiler alert) head dismemberment that is quite impressive. But most is comic book style figand battles.Must go to bathroom just before the movie because it does last 3 hours all worthwhile.</p>

        <h4>LEGO plans to find replacement material for bricks by 2030</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">In an effort to be more environmentally responsible, LEGO have said they aim to stop manufacturing bricks made of plastic resin and are considering other options, which could include hemp. According to Telegraph World, the company makes 60 billion blocks a year. While LEGO want to replace the harmful plastic used in their products, they also require the new material to meet the high standards that allow the blocks to work as they always have, especially with the effective “clicking” together is a key aspect of the iconic coloured block.</p>

        <h4>Amazon deforestation and number of fires show summer of 2019 not a 'normal' year</h4>

            <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">The perceived scale of the Amazon blazes received global attention this summer. However, international concerns raised at the time were countered by the Brazilian Government, which claimed the fire situation in August was 'normal' and 'below the historical average'.An international team of scientists writing in the journal Global Change Biology say the number of active fires in August was actually three times higher than in 2018 and the highest number since 2010.</p>
